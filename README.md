In last few years I had the oppurtunity to learn about cybersecurity, and what I have realised is that one of the most effective way to protect ourself from hackers is to be aware of cybersecurity, when we know in what ways a hacker can exploit our systems we can figureout ways to protect our systems. So in this repository I will me compiling all common ways a hacker can attack on a system and way to protect us from those attacks.
You will be suprised to know how scary easy it is to hack a system, even some amature kid without core knowledge of IT can easily hack, just by using free tools.
